### Changed
- changed the way the amount of objects is handled in the background
- the following objects have a counter which tracks the amount of connected projects
    - ActualChangeStatus, KindOfMaterial, Sample, SampleType, ChangeStatus, KindOfInquiry, MainFocus, Request, Service, Tags, PatientDataItem, PatientDataSet, PatientDataSetGroup
- fine-grained the json response of connected objects, this should result in faster loading of administration page

### Removed


### Added
- all administration components now have the same core component. this makes it easier to change and more consistent
- every administration element now has multiple tabs in their modal showing all connected objects to it. i.e when looking up main focuses you can see every projekt which has this specific main focus
- every administration element now has a statistic page
- you can now sort main focus per year in the statistics for main focus
- new statistic for patient data items showing which project chose which item
- new search functions in all modals (i.e. search connected projects or persons)
- new API endpoints to track projects of objects (i.e. KindOfInquiry)
- new API endpoints to track samples of objects (i.e. sample types, sample containers, etc)
- new API endpoints to track tiles of objects (i.e. kindofinquiry, mainfocus, tags, etc)
- New AMount tracker for projects in patient data item,set and set group
- the endpoint fo connected projects now returns the createdAt field of a project

### Fixes
- navbar in mobile can now be scrolled in the frontend
- wrong counter for main focus, kind of inquiry and requests
- fixed recursive call when checking tags in administration (this could lead to "Out of Memory" errors depending on your system)
- wrong counters, projects are now beeing counted with distinct. this should result in the correct amount <-- needs further testing
