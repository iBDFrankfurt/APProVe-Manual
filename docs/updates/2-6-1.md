## Features

### Changed
- when updating a main focus, the counter will now be called correctly
- better json view of some objects in project editing

### Removed
- call rest mail/new in frontend removed when creating a project, this was deprecated as it is now handled by the backend

### Added
- updateCounter function to update specific object AFTER a project is edited or created
- method to update all counters
- new Endpoint to change a report date of a given project

### Fixes
- todo circular dependency
- missing kindOfInquiry in projectChangeStatus -> should fix the issue not displaying the timeline correctly
- if a report date is null of a project, a new one will be correctly generated, if you open the "edit"-page of the project
