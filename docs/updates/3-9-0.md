## Feature
- PDF-Generation: Scientific Board Slides can be generated from Projectlist ([#505](https://redmine.ibdf-frankfurt.de/issues/505))

## Smaller adjustments
- updated contact e-mail

## Refactoring
- renamed some method to be clearer in what they are doing
- added @Builder pattern to some more entities like BiobankDate, Clinics, Todos and so on
- added new service and repository methods like existence checks (existsByName, existsByShortcut)...
- added createAll and createAllInBatch methods to save multiple entities faster to certain entities
- improved counter speed by 5 times approximately (e.g. patient data from 300ms to 70ms)
