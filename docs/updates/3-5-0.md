## Feature
- Advanced search for projects and persons: [view more here](../features/advanced-search.md)
- Tiles can now be opened via ```STRG + click``` in a new tab
- Sortable elements in PatientDataSet
- Implemented a caching system for project lists

## Bug
- falsely updated_at date when opening a project
- delete projects from project lists
- services where not saved when creating a project
- swapping projects from one person to another did not show every project
- sometimes patient data was not shown in the project view
- missing pagination in some tables
- "visibility" of main focus not shown correctly in project edit and submission
- project list had some nested lists not shown, for example publication ids
- services not loading in edit correctly (some 404 warnings)
- Tile info not loading projects on demand but persons, this lead to inconsistency
- users did not see there tiles
- edit had missing information on leader
- creating a sample type without a unit caused an error
- switching between sample types with and without sample containers lead to inconsistency
- faster loading of edit due to adjustments of a few GET methods returning a lot of data

## Refactoring
- Faster editing of PatientDataSetGroups if many projects where involved
- Faster creation of projects in submission by rewriting the whole code
- Removed deprecated mongo mgo driver in golang services and using mongo-driver instead

## Dependencies
- MongoDB updated
- Spring Boot updated
- PostgreSQL updated
- Restructured some pom.xml and removed unused or deprecated dependencies


## Layout
- Show PatientDataItems in project edit and view as table
- More spacing in patient data
- Fixed some texts and typos
