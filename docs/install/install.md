If all [system requirements](requirements.md) are met, you can start installing APProVe.

## Scope of delivery
We have developed a set of useful scripts to simplify the deployment of APProVe on a server.
These scripts facilitate the creation of a .env file and the generation of NGINX configuration files.
Following that, the install.sh script takes care of the APProVe installation and initiates its operation for you.

We offer three scripts, although only one of them is mandatory:

### generate_env.sh (optional)
This script takes the content from the ``.env.tmp`` file and transfers it into a new ``.env`` file.
Subsequently, you can enter essential information about your APProVe instance, such as the Realm name and the domain on which APProVe will operate.
The final step involves populating the newly generated ``.env`` file with your input.

### generate_nginx_conf (optional)
This script is designed to create NGINX configuration files based on the details in the ``.env`` file.
Furthermore, it deposits these files in the ``/etc/nginx/sites-available`` directory and establishes symbolic links in
the ``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`` folder. It generates three files, one for each subdomain. Please note that you will need to
provide the SSL certificates on your own. We highly recommend utilizing Certbot for this purpose, like so:
````shell
sudo certbot --nginx
````


### install.sh (mandatory)
This script carries out the installation of your APProVe instance in accordance with the information in your ``.env`` file.
It also configures Keycloak with a Client as specified in your ``.env`` file. Furthermore, it adds an admin user to both APProVe
and Keycloak. The default username and password for APProVe are as follows:

````shell
Username: approve-admin
Password: approve-password
````

The default username and password for Keycloak are as follows:

````shell
Username: adminuser
Password: adminpass
````

## APProVe Installation
To set up APProVe on your server, follow these steps:

1. Begin by downloading this [repository on gitlab](https://gitlab.ibdf-frankfurt.de/uct/open-approve) or this [repository on github](https://github.com/iBDFrankfurt/APProVe) manually transferring the following files to your server:

- .env.tmp
- docker-compose.yml
- generate_env.sh
- generate_nginx_conf.sh
- install.sh

2. Execute the scripts in the following order to streamline the APProVe installation process:

````shell
bash generate_env.sh

bash generate_nginx_conf.sh

certbot --nginx

install.sh
````
Should any issues or errors arise during this process, please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance.

## Data Persistence and Backup
Within the ``docker-compose.yml`` file, you'll find two named volumes that serve as a means of data persistence.

In case you wish to create manual backups of the databases, please be aware that there are essentially three separate databases:
1. Keycloak database (PostgreSQL)
2. APProVe database (PostgreSQL)
3. Additional data, such as comments or mail records, are stored in MongoDB (MongoDB).

To simplify the backup process, we have developed a script named ``backup.sh.`` Be sure to adjust the script's variables to align with the settings in your ``.env`` file.


## System Setup
Before APProVe can be put into operation, further steps must be taken after installation.
These are explained in more detail in the following [Chapter: Setup & commissioning](setup.md).
